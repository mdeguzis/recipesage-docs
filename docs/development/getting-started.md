title: Getting Started
---

## Primer

Please first take a look at the base GitHub repository https://github.com/julianpoy/recipesage. The [README](https://github.com/julianpoy/RecipeSage/blob/master/README.md) file there describes the basic approach and setup of the project.

## Development Tools

At a minimum, you'll want to install:

* Node
* Docker

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Clone this repo
3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the repository using `example.env` as a template. These can be left as placeholders, but the dependent functionality will not work without a real key in place.
4. Install dependencies by running `npm install` at the root of the repo.
5. Start the Docker containers by running `docker compose up -d` in the cloned repo
6. Run database migrations `docker compose exec backend npx prisma migrate dev`
7. RecipeSage should be running on `localhost` on port `80``

## Building 

### New code changes

Whenever you change code, you'll want to tear down and recreate the environment(s):
```
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

You can leave off of the `-d / --detach` argument to monitor for active errors while you test the website, or better yet, use `docker logs`.

You can force docker to ignore container cache and force a build of the image layers with:
```
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Running Tests

Validate schema
```
docker compose exec backend npx prisma validate
```

Backend tests
```
docker compose exec backend env NODE_ENV=test POSTGRES_LOGGING=false npx nx test backend
```
